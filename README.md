# Google Dino Game Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a Gym environment for the Google Dino game and training a reinforcement learning model to play the game. The implementation is done using Jupyter notebooks, making it easy to follow and modify.

## Features

Gym Environment Creation: A custom Gym environment for the Google Dino game.
Reinforcement Learning Model: Development and training of a reinforcement learning model.
Training Process: Step-by-step training of the model within the Jupyter notebook.
Prerequisites

### Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python packages
